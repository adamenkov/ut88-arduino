# Build 8080-based retro computer UT-88 ([ЮТ-88](https://jtdigest.narod.ru/kollection/ut88/ut88.htm)) using Arduino microcontrollers

Use the sketch `mega` to build the basic version of the retro computer UT-88 (ЮТ-88) with merely [Z80, Arduino Mega 2560, LCD display shield, 4x4 keypad, and 8 wires](https://www.hackster.io/a7v/building-retro-computer-ut-88-with-z80-and-arduino-mega-2560-3a96dd).

Use the sketch `mega-i2c-display-keyboard-matrix` to build the version with an HDMI screen and a TEC-1 matrix keyboard (you can use your own keyboard with some coding).  The article about it is work-in-progress.
